You are free to use any part of my work in your projects so long as you give me credit.


Installation:
-------------

1. This mod is not compatible with any other mods since I've most likely modified a file that another mod uses.
  a. You will need to remove all mods from your King's Bounty: The Legend "mods" folder before installation of this mod.
  b. Ensure that the "mods" folder exists, it is typically located here: C:\Program Files (x86)\1C Company\King's Bounty\data\mods
    i. If the "mods" folder does not exist then create it below the "data" folder using the path above as a guide.
2. Extract 4 of the 5 *.KFS files included in this archive to the King's Bounty: The Legend mods folder.
  a. This folder is typically here: C:\Program Files (x86)\1C Company\King's Bounty\data\mods
  b. If the "mods" folder does not exist, then see note 1bi above.
  c. The 4 KFS files are:
    i.   mod_homm3_portraits.kfs - stand alone game picture resources containing all *.DAT and *.DDS files that may be used in other mods.
    ii.  mod_tougher_eheroes.kfs - stand alone tougher heroes containing all *.HERO files that may be used in other mods.
    iii. mod_homm3_babies.kfs - core HOMM3 babies mod files containing all *.ACT, *.ATOM, *.CHAT, *.LUA, and *.TXT files modified for this mod. This also contains TEMPLATES.LNG, the universal language template file (all other *.LNG files are in a different KFS).
    iv.  mod_homm3_babies_eng_lng.kfs ***OR*** mod_homm3_babies_en_lng.kfs - updated *.LNG files
      1) Use mod_homm3_babies_eng_lng.kfs for your English localization with eng_*.lng
      2) Use mod_homm3_babies_en_lng.kfs for your English localization with en_*.lng
      3) DO NOT USE BOTH FILES!!! Just one or the other!!!
  d. All 4 KFS files are needed for the complete HOMM3 babies mod experience and the game will not load without them!
3. Run the game
  a. Start a new game to play!
  b. It is not recommended to continue your current game, please restart.
  c. For your first play through:
    i.   Please do not use any cheats (i.e. Save Game Scanner, etc.)
    ii.  Please do not use with any other mods (probably won't work anyway)
    iii. You'll be able to experience the mod as I intended it to be played.


Uninstallation:
---------------

1. Simply delete the 4 KFS files from your "mods" folder:
  a. mod_homm3_portraits.kfs
  b. mod_tougher_eheroes.kfs
  c. mod_homm3_babies.kfs
  d. mod_homm3_babies_eng_lng.kfs OR mod_homm3_babies_en_lng.kfs depending on your English localization variant
2. Done!


Notes:
------

1. This mod was developed using the Gamer's Gate V1.7 version of King's Bounty: The Legend.
2. I have not tried it with other versions.
3. This mod uses the English localizations using both the "eng_" and "en_" prefixes for the localization files.
  a. As mentioned above, only one of those files is needed to play the game.
  b. Other versions may have other prefixes and so you may be able to get this mod to work with your localization version by changing the prefixes of the *.LNG localization files.
    i.   The *.LNG files are located inside mod_homm3_babies_en_lng.kfs or mod_homm3_babies_eng_lng.kfs both file sets are identical so either may be used as a baseline.
    ii.  Simply rename *.kfs to *.zip and extract files if you wish to attempt this.
    iii. Currently, you're on your own if you want to get it to work with a different localization, but if you'd like to help with localizations in your country then please let me know.


Issues / Bugs:
--------------

Since this is a beta release of this mod, it is quite possible that your game will crash or you'll find bugs in this mod. Please provide me feedback on any issues that you are having with my mod so that I can make improvements and make your playing experience more enjoyable.

If you have any problems during play, here are some pointers:

1. If it is a game crash, note which action caused the crash.
2. If the game appears to lock up, ALT-TAB back to Windows to see if there is a pop-up.
  a. If there is a pop-up window, note the message and then click OK to proceed.
  b. After you click OK, the game will most likely crash exit to Windows.
  c. If the game does not crash after you click OK, it is highly recommended to quit your game rather than continue since behavior may be strange.
3. Save your game often just in case!
4. If the game locks up when you cursor over a child or item, there is a misspelling in one of the templates:
  a. Note which child it is when this happens
  b. Contact me and let me know which child it is and I'll correct the error
  c. I hope we've found all these errors!
5. Try to load from a save game and see if it still crashes in the same spot. If it crashes in the same spot, the only hope I have of resolving the issue is for:
  a. You to provide me a savegame.
  b. Provide me the exact steps to repeat the crash.
  c. Without these, my chance of resolving this issue is probably very slim.

Crash List
----------

1. I've had crashes with a failure to allocate more memory a couple of times.
  a. The solution is to reload your most recent save game and simply continue.
  b. Let me know if you see this problem, but currently I have no idea how to resolve it (I probably would need 1CC or Katauri Interactive's help with this one).
  c. This problem seems to exhibit itself after you've been playing a long gaming session (it seems like I run into this after playing for several hours).

Bug List:
---------

1. Damage causing effects (i.e. burning and poison):
  a. If an AI unit is killed by a damage causing effect and if the next unit to move is another AI unit, then their damage causing effect is skipped if they have one.
  b. I worked and worked trying to fix this bug, but to no avail.
    i.  I'm pretty sure that it is a bug with the game itself as I don't think they intended for damaging effects to kill units.
    ii. As such, I don't know how to fix this bug, but if you have any ideas then please let me know!

If you notice any other problems or issues, then please let me know!

It is my intent to make this mod as bug free and enjoyable as possible!


Updates:
--------

1. As this version of the mod is in a beta state, there are still changes that are being done; however:
  a. The mod is stable enough to play the game completely through - enjoy!
  b. Every change has been checked at least once, but I'm in the quality assurance phase rechecking the code.
  c. I'm currently play testing the game with a Paladin.
2. At this stage, changes should not require you to restart your game - simply install the new files and continue playing.
  a. Changes will be focused on editing data files (i.e. *.ATOM, *.TXT) to improve game balance and user enjoyability.
  b. New features can still be added, but only if they are really good ideas!
3. Updates will most likely occur on a monthly basis depending on severity and other factors.
4. Once the quality assurance phase is completed and sufficient feedback is garnered, the project will transition to the release phase.
5. The release phase will have all features properly implemented and all controllable bugs fixed.


Modders:
--------

1. I've made many changes under the hood that only modders or code aficionados would notice.
2. I've added comments where warranted to the areas in the game that I've changed, but not everywhere.
  a. Feel free to look at these comments and provide me feedback if you know of a better way to implement something.
  b. Certain comments have the word "HACK" where I did not know how to do it a better way - once again if you know a better way to implement this feature then please let me know!
3. I've unified many *.LUA functions (i.e. like SPELLS_POWER.LUA) so that they all use the same bonus system, etc.
4. I've made common functions for dealing with redundant code.
  a. The original *.LUA files had lots and lots of redundant code.
  b. I've replaced most of the redundant code in the *.LUA functions I've edited to reduce error and provide code consistency.
5. I've beautified the sections of the *.LUA files I've changed to make reading the code much, much easier.
6. The changes I've made really form the basis of a new code base from which you can create new mods.

  & TEMPLATES.LNG
    ^ Added new templates for Shaman's Dancing Axes attack
  & PAWN.LUA - no changes, just beautified the code a little bit
  & SPECIAL_ATTACKS.LUA
    ^ Changed how Shaman's Dancing Axes works:
      % 80% of damage becomes "Titan Energy" that resurrects friendly Orc troops
      % 80% of the remaining Titan Energy not used by resurrecting friendly Orc troops heals other friendly troops
      % 80% of the remaining Titan Energy not used by healing friendly troops is stored on the Shaman for use later
      % The 20% dissipation only occurs if the energy is used at that step:
        $ I.e. if there are no friendly Orc troops to heal then 20% of the energy is not lost
	$ I.e. if there are no friendly troops to heal then 20% of the energy is not lost
	$ I.e. at the beginning of combat no one is typically hurt yet, so 80% of the damage is stored on the Shaman as Titan Energy in this case
      % The Titan Energy stored on the Shaman dissipates 20% each round until one of its abilities is used again
      % If the Shaman casts one of its Totems, then 80% of the energy is used to increase the health of the totem with 20% dissipating and being stored on the Shaman.
    ^ This change is HIGHLY experimental and may make Orcs too powerful - we'll have to playtest to see...
  & SPECIAL_HINT.LUA - updated the Shaman's Dancing Axes hint

	% +Rage% (x2 above) (if mother has more than 1 child)
	% +Rage Inflow% (x2 above) (if mother has more than 1 child)
    ^ Babies with the HOMM3 Tactics Skill now have these variants:
      % +Attack / Defense (same as before)
      % -Enemy Speed or -Enemy Initiative (depends on number of babies under wife)
      % -Enemy Speed and -Initiative (if baby had Advanced Tactics - Lacus is the only one)
    ^ Babies with Necromancy (pretty much all Rina's babies)
      % If the baby had a bonus to an undead unit, the Necromany Skill was changed to increase the level of their other skill by 1
      % Some other babies with Necromancy left alone
      % I.e. Charna had Necromancy, Tactics, and Wights (Wights -> Ghosts) and so her Necromancy became Advanced Tactics
      % I.e. Sandro (Rina) stays the same
      % I.e. Young Sandro (Feanora) gets Expert Sorcery (only baby with Expert Sorcery)!
      % This makes Rina's children a little bit more varied:
        $ Babies are more useful if you want to use other units with her
	$ Lessens the focus on her for getting so many undead units
    ^ Babies with HOMM3 Leadership (a lot of Mirabella's babies)
      % Similar to Necromancy, to prevent so many morale bonuses, the babies other skill increased a level
      % Helps give fewer morale bonuses from Mirabella's babies so that you can't get as much +morale (but get other bonuses instead)
      % Gives a bit more variety to her children
      % Sylvia's Leadership to Expert Navigation
      % Haart's Leadership to Expert Estates
    ^ Babies with HOMM3 Mysticism now get +2 or +4 mana per round instead of +1 or +2 per round (2x)
    ^ Babies with HOMM3 Navigation:
      % Bonus now applies to Forest and Snow combat as well (babies affected: Voy and Sylvia)
    ^ Babies with HOMM3 Eagle Eye now have the varients:
      % Intellect: +%
      % Enemy Resistance: -% (based on mother's resistance, i.e. Gerda would be -Resist All)
    ^ Babies with HOMM3 Offense or Archery:
      % Now they need at least Advanced skill level for +1 to damage type
      % Now they need Expert level for +2 to damage type
      % +Damage bonus stays the same

  & 276213879.hero - error in Martin Vodash's attack value (was 5 should have been 8)

Version: Alpha 2011-11-19

Fixes:

* LOGIC_HERO.LUA had an error in it where for Easy and Normal difficulty level, the level up didn't work correctly.

Thanks to erkki (Erkilmarl) for helping find and fix this bug!

Changes:

* Updated Sleem's Cloud of Poison such that the early levels mana increase is less and for the 2nd upgrade you need Sleem to be higher level to get it.
  & I recently updated Sleem's Cloud of Poison before restarting my new game and as I played the previous values didn't feel right.

Additions:

* I've added the en_ language files for those users of the game with the alternate English locality files.

Crash Fixes:

* Rina had a mispelling in one of her child names in wifes.txt. This would cause a crash to desktop when Rina was having a baby.

This archive contains all the files for the HOMM3 Babies mod / micro / mini expansion pack for King's Bounty: The Legend. This work will be referred to loosely as the mod in the rest of this document.

There are many changes to the game, but at this time I do not have them listed here. In the future, this file will list those changes. In the mean time, visit the YouTube video page: http://youtu.be/JE0VbSnfYkM and the King's Bounty: The Legend Mod forum for more information: http://forum.1cpublishing.eu/showthread.php?p=360731#post360731.
